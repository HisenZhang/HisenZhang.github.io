Poets often use many words 
to say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme
to make a poem sing
With music and words I'm playing
For you I have written this song
To be sure 
that you know what I'm saying 
I will translate as I go along

<hr>

Fly me to the moon 
远走高飞
and let me play among the stars
我们遨游星河
Let me see what spring is like 
在遥远的星星上
on Jupiter and Mars
又有着怎样的春光
In other words 
今日
Hold my hands
执子之手
In other words 
只愿
Daring kiss me
与子偕老
Fill my heart with song 
沉浸于音乐
and let me sing forever more
我纵声放歌
You are all I long for
只为一人
all I worship and adore
那唯一的爱慕
In other words
啊
please be true
让这一切成真
In other words 
低吟浅唱着
I love you
"我喜欢你."
